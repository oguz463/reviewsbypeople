              <h1>Who we are</h1>
              <p>Reviews By People is a user-driven product review and comparison website which started its journey in 2018. All the content on this website is posted by actual users and qualified writers.</p>

              <p>That’s what separates “Reviews By People” from other comparison websites. We aim to help consumers find the right product for their budget and lifestyle by providing them with unbiased reviews and tips along the way.</p>

              <h2>Qualified Writers and Niche Experts</h2>

              <p>All the writers on Reviews By People go through an intricate approval process and then they are asked to send samples of their writing. This way we get rid of spam content, biased reviews and articles of plagiarism. </p>

              <h2>So what does the future hold?</h2>

              <p>Reviews by People is a new website with big goals. As the website is user-driven, we will try to get as many products reviewed as possible - even multiple times. </p>

              <p>To give a clear example; let’s say you are looking for a “fish finder” but can’t decide which one to choose. Here on “Reviews By People” you will find multiple reviews written by different writers and topic related veterans. In this case, for example fishermen/seafarers. </p>

              <p>As it’s written from the different aspects of real people, this gives you the versatility to choose the right article and angle for your platform. </p>
